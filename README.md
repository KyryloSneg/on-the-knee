# Welcome to the first web (frontend) app of mine *"On the knee"*
## Why have I made it?
I was thinking a long time about making an e-shop / marketplace website like **ROZETKA** or **Citrus** did, so when I learned the basics of React I started working on it. And, despite the time I spent on bringing my idea to live, I did it.
## Technology stack
- HTML5, CSS, JS (of course)
- React and React-related libraries (like RHF)
- Mobx
## What could be improved?
- using css vars
- using already existing ui libs (I wanted to implement most of them from "scratch")
- using libraries that provides different animations (same as with the previous point)
- using the real server instead of the mock one, as it would decrease the amount of unefficient client-side filtrations, sorting etc. (but it's a frontend project, so idc)
- implementing panels for content, order and seller managers, sellers themselves and maybe for the owner
- some tiny optimizations for various data fetching logic
- replace moment.js library with something modern
- using google maps (but i don't want to leak my address in order to use them)
